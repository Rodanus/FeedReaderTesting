# Feed Reader Testing

I was given this web-based application that reads RSS feeds with one test written by another developer using [Jasmine](https://devhints.io/jasmine) and I've added the necessary tests to test the application.
[The original repository can be found here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)


## How To Run

After cloning the repository, you simply open the `index.html` in your favorite browser, also note that there are two versions of this application, the first one is inside the folder named `src` which is the developers version, and the second one is inside `dist` which is the production version.

## Build Tool Used

Since it is a small project, I've decided to use [Prepros](https://prepros.io/), all you have to do is to download it and get familiar with its basics, I suggest you [watch this tutorial to learn how to use Prepros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jftHT-INOno)
